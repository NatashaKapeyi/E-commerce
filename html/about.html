    <h2 class="center"><strong>A BRIEF HISTORY OF VANS:
        “OFF THE WALL” SINCE ‘66</h2></strong> 
        <As class="paragraph">In terms of skate shoes, Vans is still regarded as one of the top manufacturers. Their collaborations with brands like WTAPS and Blends in the past, together with the fact that their shoes have become legends in their own right, have guaranteed their place in the Hall of Fame for Sneakers.
            What distinguishes a Vans slip-on?
            
            Since 1979, the Slip-On has been a trendsetter.
            
            
            The comfort is handled by the rubber waffle outsoles, supportive padded collars, and low-profile canvas uppers. The only thing left to do is slide in and start traveling. The popular Slip-On sneakers from Vans offer equal parts comfort and convenience.
          
        As always, it is the fundamental ability to be worn by all ages and all backgrounds that gives Vans the ability to transcend cultures and time. Whether on the halfpipe or on the runway, the canvas clad kicks have served as a canvas for creatives of all iterations.</p>
